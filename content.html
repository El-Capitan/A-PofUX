    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The following content is a reflection on the team efforts, organization, and process decisions made throughout a team final project for VMD-127: User Experience. This webpage is the result of the final project for VMD-142: Web Production III. Both courses taught at City College San Francisco, in lovely SF, CA.</p>
        
        <p>Content requirements included demonstrating mastery of the iterative process and evidence-based user-centric design decisions while working as a team to levearage creative genious. The charge was to create either a gardening-centric application or website mockup with our new skills and turn in the process collateral in the form of a project book in .pdf form.</p>
        
        <p>Functional requirements for the development of this site required demonstrating the use of external libraries with custom style rules and responsive breakpoints, integrating custom javaScript, and doing so with a scrum-based process (goal setting in between short development sprints).</p>

    <h2>The Team</h2>
        <h3>Reynaldo Barrioz</h3>
            <p>Sprintmaster/User Advocate/Graphic Design</p>
            <p>Reynaldo is methodical, enthusiastic, and impecibly well-organized. His creative prowess is reflected throughout the project, but his can-do attitude afforded opportunities such as seamlessly connecting to the project's target community.</p>
        
        <h3>Serene Chu</h3>
            <p>Information Architect/Content Strategist</p>
            <p>Don't let Serene's patient and contemplative front fool you. Serene is a fire storm of enthusiasm and tact and is an exceptional asset with the ability to distil conceptual ideas into manageable chunks.</p>
    
        <h3>Kseniya Kuzmina</h3>
            <p>Graphic Design Lead/Mock-up Master</p>
            <p>Without Kseniya's ability to deliver quality graphic content from lo-fidelity wireframes and mockups on short deadlines, the quality of this project would have undoubtedly suffered. Kseniya is talented, thoughtful and was essential to the success of this project as a whole.</p>
        
        <h3>Patrick Willey</h3>
            <p>Product Advocate/Copy Writer/Web Master</p>
            <p>Patrick's 'good wordery', coding experience, and organization proved an asset for the project deliverables and his contributions were invaluable to the direction of the project (he's cute too, but self-efficacy is clearly an advantage of being the one who writes the copy and codes the website).</p>

    <h2>The Aproach</h2>
        <h4>a.k.a Ground Rules</h4>
        <p>Immediately the team agreed on a working organization similar to SCRUM where goals and milestones are set and achieved as a team in short periods of time. At every team meeting short term goals were assessed and revised for the following 'sprint' to the next meeting. This working schema helped the team to iterate on ideas quickly, stay organized, and achieve a high level of productivity in a short period of time while allowing each member to contribute with their strenghs first.</p>

    <h2>Discovery Phase</h2>
        <h4>or What We Thought We Knew</h4>
        <p>Initially, the team identified several areas where we could leverage a competitive advantage toward the goal of creating THE resource for gardening. With the team based in San Francisco, CA, we quickly determined that not only would our solution require a robust plant database with information about climates that individual plants thrive best in, but information on gardening in the various micro-climates (i.e. growing zones) peppered throughout the bay and similarly varied geographic areas.</p>
        <h3>Monetization</h3>
            <p>Monetization at this point was considered to be via strategic partnerships with region-specific garden centers who would advertise sales and benefits for our users.</p>
</article>

<article>
    <h2>Competitive analysis</h2>
        <h4>or How Others Seem to Be Doing It</h4>
        <p>Initial competitive analysis was limited to websites geared toward similar goals of providing relevant information to gardeners. All four sites shared some successful elements including reasonably well-organized layout and the standard inclusion of social media, vivid imagery, and an ‘About Us’ page, however there was a dearth of a modern feel, responsive design, and substantial interactivity.</p>
    
<!-- add a row of the 4 sites thumbnails - highlight a key strength and a key weakness -->
   
        <p>The sites appeared to be mostly about themselves and less about robust and actionable information for the people visiting them. From this review the team found a competitive advantage by choosing to create a user-centered mobile application that will include access to video content, robust plant and planting information (seasons, growth zones, etc.), and create a community for users to interact and share information and images.</p>

    <h3>Need to Pivot</h3>
        <h4>The best laid plans...</h4>
        <p>The team briefly perused the Apple iTunes&reg; and Google Play&reg; online stores and found the target application had already been created. We had been scooped by some upstart garden community (sarcasm) known as The Royal Horticultural Society. Those unfamiliar with RHS should know that they are essentially THE authority in the horticulture community. Defeat did not set in on the team as we still had an ace in the hole: a need for local harvesting and gleaning. None of the apps and sites reviewed ALSO offered a portal to physical community assistance.</p>

    <h2>User Research</h2>
        <h4>Surveys here, come take ye'r survey!</h4>
        <p>Several prospective app. users were surveyed at a local Santa Cruz, CA farmers market. Respondants confirmed interest in using a gardening app. and provided a wealth of information regarding content decisions and features they'd both desire and dislike.</p>

    <h2>Skeletal Phase</h2>
        <h4>or How We Assembled and Built a Solution Together</h4>
        <h3>Whiteboarding</h3>
    <p>Getting ideas down on paper, literally, was an invaluable asset to the team quickly iterating on complex ideas. Card-sortting exercises allowed the team to start to assemble a logical site map.</p>
    
        <h3>Personae or personas?</h3>
            <p>Based on the survey respondents, assembled to identify and target future app users: a 'power-user' , a 'low-tech' hobbiest, and a 'hi-tech' amateur.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Plant database content</li>
                <li>Member forum</li>

            </ul>
            
        <h3>User Flow Diagram</h3>
            <p>To best meet the project timeline and complete all deliverables, the team had to reduce the scope of this project. Admittedly, were the team pursuing the development of this app. further, a complete set of user flow diagrams to detail each interaction would have been created. As it stands, the team focused on the app's competitive advantage: scheduling harvesting/gleaning and participation in workshops. This exercise gave the team a consensus framework for devising the inital wireframes.</p>
    
        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>With an understanding of the process required to accomplish some basic app. tasks the team assembled a collection of lo-fidelity wireframes. Screens were divvied up among the team members to individually wireframe, however as overachievers tend to do, several nearly complete sets were generated. The big win here was two-fold. First, the team confirmed that we were all on the same page toward how the final product ought to look and function. Second, with more than one conceptual rendering we were able to cherry-pick from the strenghts of each one.</p>
        <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            <p>The team found a lean style tile template online to use for developing the style rules. This was a living document and matured throughout the course of the project.</p>

<article>    
    <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>Preparing for user testing included devising a use case scenario, a mock-up demo of the app from high-fidelity wireframes, and creating an engaging, but meaningful test script to learn the successes and shortcomings of the design.</p>
        
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>The use case scenario focused on the residential user. They realize that they have an uncanny need for the app., quickly download and install it to their favorite device, create a sign-in, and then take advantage of the app's features.</p>
            
        <h3>Hi-Fi Demo Wireframes</h3>
            <p>First-iteration high-fidelity wireframes were generated and used with demo software for initial user testing.</p>
           <!-- thumbnails of v.1 hi-fi wireframes on top of a screen grab of the invision demo-->
        
        <h3>Test Script</h3>
            <p>The team generated a test script to better understand how a first time user would interact with the app. Since the target audience had some specificity the script contained background information for the test user to understand their motivations for using the app.</p>
        
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>Since this was a class project, the team benefitted not only from a stellar 'test subject', but from the gold-mine of input from a diverse group of astute design students and the course instructor.</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Color, imagery, and style well received</li>
                <li>Icons and layout understandable</li>
                <li>Consider reordering home screen icons</li>
                <li>Onboarding too wordy</li>
                <li>Consider a tag line</li>
                <li>Consider name revision</li>
            </ul>
</article>

<article>
    <h2>Final Sprint</h2>
       <p>With less than a week left for the project, the team rallied for one final sprint to achieve a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) concept that integrated the user feedback.</p>
        <h3>Minimum Viable Product</h3>
            <p>The most substantial change between the beta app. version and MVP was the development of a simpler onboarding proceedure. Where the initial concept had several windows with multiple lines of text each, the finalized version condensed each of the windows into an animated tile. Each tile was given a corresponding icon and tag line to describe a primary feature and appears briefly in a short animation on the first use of the app. This decision not only addressed the complexity of the previous onboarding, but concerns regarding wordiness as well.</p>
        <h3>Final Demo</h3>
            <p>Many of the primary feedback items were also addressed and the final demo is hosted via Invision <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/5D5DRDFEV#/screens/123835564">HERE</a>.</p>
